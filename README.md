#TECHNOLOGIES:
This project was developed using HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, Query, CURL, AJAX.

#PLANNING/DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
Followed the guidelines provided by G.A. consultants.
  - Created user stories and wireframe, to figure out how I wanted my project
to look like and the functions that I wanted it to have.
  - For the development process, I did the authentication steps first. Made
sure that all buttons were working properly and triggering the right events.
  - After that I moved to creating the game engine. Created my table using HTML
first and then started to build the Javascript functions and Jquery functions
for DOM interaction.
  - Once the board was done, next step was to create the winning (and draw)
conditions and have those conditions checked after each move.
  - Last thing I did was making the game communicate with the API. Still have
some functions to finish, but most of it is already functional.

#UNSOLVED PROBLEMS
- UI interaction (show/hide buttons, work on the messages displayed after each
event, work on Restart button)
- API communication (have the board communicate with the API, be able to access
unfinished games and print that for the user to see)
- Styling (Add colors, change text, create boxes for messages)
- Replacing console.log functions on assets/scripts/auth/ui.js file
